In 2003 Cohn and Elkies \cite{ElkiesCohn}  developed  linear programming bounds that apply directly to sphere packings. The goal of this section is to formalize the Cohn--Elkies linear programming bound.

The following theorem is the key result of \cite{ElkiesCohn}. (Note that the original theorem is stated for a class of functions more general then Schwartz functions.)

The main step in our proof of \cref{SpherePacking.MainTheorem} is the explicit construction of an optimal function. It will be convenient for us to scale this function by $\sqrt{2}$.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:g}\uses{thm:g1}
There exists a radial Schwartz function $g:\R^8\to\R$ which satisfies:
\begin{align}
g(x)&\leq 0\mbox{ for } \|x\|\geq \sqrt{2} \label{eqn:g1}\\
\widehat{g}(x)&\geq0\mbox{ for all } x\in\R^8\label{eqn:g2}\\
g(0)&=\widehat{g}(0)=1.\label{eqn:g3}
\end{align}
\end{theorem}
Theorem \ref{LinearProgrammingBound} applied to the optimal function $f(x)=g(x/\sqrt{2})$ immediately implies \cref{SpherePacking.MainTheorem}.
